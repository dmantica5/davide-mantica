# Employee Attrition Analysis â€“ Salifort Motors

This repository contains the Capstone Project from the Google Data Analytics course, focused on analyzing employee satisfaction and predicting attrition for the fictional company Salifort Motors.

## Objective
The project aims to identify the key factors influencing employees' decisions to leave the company using data analysis and machine learning. A predictive model was developed in Jupyter Notebook to estimate with significant accuracy which employees are most likely to leave.

## Approach
- Data exploration and cleaning based on HR records
- Trend analysis to identify the main causes of attrition
- Development of a predictive model to estimate resignation risks
- Interpretation of results and recommendations to reduce turnover

## Impact
The insights from this analysis provide strategic value to Salifort Motors, enabling proactive interventions to retain key employees and optimize costs associated with turnover.

## Introduction
The project follows the PACE framework.
The PACE framework (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) provides a structured approach to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python projects. It ensures a systematic workflow for understanding, processing, and deriving insights from data before further modeling or decision-making.

Plan: This phase involves defining objectives, understanding the dataset, and setting up the development environment. Establishing a clear roadmap helps in efficiently managing resources and structuring the project.

Analyze: This step focuses on inspecting the data, handling missing values, identifying patterns, and visualizing distributions. Statistical summaries and correlation analysis provide insights into potential relationships within the dataset.

Construct: Based on the analysis, data transformations, feature engineering, and preprocessing steps are implemented. Cleaning data, handling outliers, and preparing features for further analysis or modeling are essential in this stage.

Execute: The final phase involves validating the transformations, documenting findings, and integrating the results into the broader analytical pipeline. Automation and reproducibility play a crucial role in ensuring consistent outcomes.

By following the PACE framework, an EDA process becomes structured, repeatable, and efficient, enabling better data-driven decision-making.

### PLAN
The planning phase is where the project's purpose is defined, and the steps required to complete it are developed.

The capstone project of the course involved a data analysis project for the fictional company Salifort Motors. The challenge focused on improving employee satisfaction within the company. The task was to better understand the reasons why employees were leaving and to propose data-driven solutions based on information collected by the HR department.

Through data analysis, I aimed to identify the key factors influencing employees' decisions to leave the company. Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, I was guided through the development of a predictive model in Jupyter Notebook, capable of accurately forecasting whether and when an employee is likely to leave.

This analysis and the predictive model I developed offer a strategic opportunity for Salifort Motors. The company can leverage these insights to take proactive measures, retain key employees, and reduce turnover-related costs such as recruitment and training.
