# Tableau Projects - Introduction  
This section contains my Tableau projects, developed to gain hands-on experience with basic functionalities. Each project focuses on exploring and visualizing datasets to identify trends, patterns, and insights. Through these exercises, I have practiced key Tableau features such as data connections, calculated fields, filters, and interactive dashboards.  

These projects represent my initial approach to data analysis and visualization, and I'm working to further develop my skills over time.

This project analyzes employee retention using various factors such as salary level, department, work accidents, promotions, satisfaction level, and performance evaluations.
The dataset contains information on employees who stayed with or left the company, allowing us to explore key patterns affecting retention.

Key Insights:
 - The majority of employees stayed with the company (83.04%), while 16.66% left.
 - Sales is the department with the highest number of employees.
 - Most employees have a medium salary level, while fewer have a high salary.
 - Promotions in the last 5 years were rare.
 - Employees with work accidents seem to be a smaller proportion of the workforce.
 - Employee satisfaction and evaluation scores vary significantly, impacting retention.

The visualizations were created to identify trends and potential factors contributing to employee turnover.
