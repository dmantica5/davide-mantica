### Tableau Projects - Introduction  
This section contains my Tableau projects, developed to gain hands-on experience with basic functionalities. Each project focuses on exploring and visualizing datasets to identify trends, patterns, and insights. Through these exercises, I have practiced key Tableau features such as data connections, calculated fields, filters, and interactive dashboards.  

These projects represent my initial approach to data analysis and visualization, and I hope to further develop my skills over time.
